## Laravel Dingo/API Boilerplate (JWT Edition) for Laravel 6.5

Laravel API Boilerplate is a "starter kit" that has login and registration methods.
It uses JSON WEB TOKEN authentication.

Thanks to the following big guys:

* JWT-Auth - [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
* Dingo API - [dingo/api](https://github.com/dingo/api)
* Laravel-CORS [barryvdh/laravel-cors](http://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors)



## Installation

1. run `composer create-project enmohsinali/Laravel-API-JWT-Boilerplate myApiProject`;
2. have a coffee, nothing to do here;

Once the project creation procedure will be completed, run the `php artisan migrate` command to install the required tables.
